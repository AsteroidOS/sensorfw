This folder contains examples for extending sensord.

Current examples:

adaptorplugin: Instructions for writing a new adaptor plugin based on
               SysfsAdaptor.

Examples on how to use the sensor framework from client applications
might be here someday as well. For now, the fastest way to get started
is to have a look in the tests folder, specifically tests/client.
